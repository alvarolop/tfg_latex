	abstract = {Metrics commonly used to assess the energy efficiency of data centres are analysed through performing and critiquing a case study calculation of energy efficiency. Specifically, the metric Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which has become a de facto standard within the data centre industry, will be assessed. This is achieved by using open source specifications for a data centre in Prineville, Oregon, USA provided by the Open Compute Project launched by the social networking company Facebook. The usefulness of the PUE metric to the IT industry is critically assessed and it is found that whilst it is important for encouraging lower energy consumption in data centres, it does not represent an unambiguous measure of energy efficiency.},

                significant opportunity for energy optimization. As a first step toward enabling
                energy efficient

                consolidation, we study the inter-relationships between energy consumption,
                resource utilization, and performance of consolidated workloads. The study
                reveals the energy performance trade-offs for consolidation and shows that
                optimal operating points exist. We model the consolidation problem as a modified
                bin packing problem and illustrate it with an example. Finally, we outline the
                challenges in finding effective solutions to the consolidation

                problem.</p>},
